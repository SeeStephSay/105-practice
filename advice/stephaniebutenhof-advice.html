                            <h2>Feeling Discouraged?</h2>
                            <h3>It's totally NORMAL!</h3>
                            <p>Don't worry, be happy! For real - those thoughts and feelings about how "Maybe I'm not cut out for JavaScript (or insert-other-language-here)," and "Maybe I'm not smart enough." are Imposter Syndrome rearing its ugly head.</p>
                            <p>Seriously - EVERY. SINGLE. <em>SUCCESSFUL.</em> DEVELOPER I have talked to has felt the <strong>EXACT SAME THING</strong> when they were first learning, as well. </p>

                            <h2>Follow the 20-Minute Rule</h2>
                            <p>When you can't figure something out, spend 20 minutes trying to figure it out on your own, before asking someone else for help. It's easy to get caught up, and spend an hour or more on an issue, when it could be an easy fix.</p>

                            <h2>Talk to a Rubber Ducky</h2>
                            <p>... or some other inanimate object! Start by literally talking through your problem out loud. Try to figure out how you might ask a question. Sometimes, simply verbalizing what you need to know can help you figure it out.
